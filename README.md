# Linearregressionexamples
 In this project, we will analyze a CSV file showing the revenue generated from ice cream sales based on temperature changes.
 
 In this analysis, we will examine the dataset, understand basic statistics and data distributions.
 
 Then, we will visualize the relationship between temperature and sales revenue, and create a linear regression model to confirm this relationship.
 
 Our linear regression model will help us predict the impact of temperature changes on ice cream sales.
